* Graphical flow for programs

* Limitations

The idea of graphical programming languages is linked with the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch_limit][Deutsch_limit]] (for noted programmer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Peter_Deutsch][L Peter Deutsch]], not [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch][David Deutsch

* Automatically create visual interfaces

Here's an idea: assuming we have enough text mining pixie dust (on
corpora of linux man pages, and stack overflow questions/forum posts
about linux commands), it might be possible to do:

=user:~$ make-gui-for ls --output ls.py=

* Next steps
