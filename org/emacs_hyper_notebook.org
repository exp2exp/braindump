We are developing a better way to do “Jupyter notebooks” using Emacs.
This recovers some of the Research Collab ideas developed by Aaron
Krowne. It should integrate features such as writing and task
management (e.g., /Org/) Program evaluation (e.g., /Maxima/),
Typesetting and presentation (e.g., slides via /LaTeX/), and
navigation (e.g., /Org Roam/ for displaying topics as a graph).  We
should be clear that the various technologies used are slot-fillers
and they might be replaced with other things, or augmented (e.g.,
/Lean/ for formal verification of some of the above?). A useful input
to this process would be implementation of examples without
integration.  This can then be redone in a more integrated fashion.

An integration using existing technologies will have limitations, once
we have this demos then we will see some of the gaps and how more
advanced tech could be useful. (For example, Ray’s work with Gerschom
could turn out to be useful here.)

* Partial prototypes

How far can we go...

- Through Roam? (Talk to Connor about Roam on Twitter?)
- Through Jupyter?
- [[https://foambubble.github.io/foam/][Foam?]] [[https://gtoolkit.com/][Glamorous Toolkit?]]

Can we integrate it with existing tools?  Do Lenses help with this?
Would it play a role as a backend system?
