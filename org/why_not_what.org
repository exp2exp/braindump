Our purpose:

- *We want to make the knowledge economy accessible to everyone.*
- *Web 2.0 hasnâ€™t achieved that, although it has produced a large pool of open data.*
- *We will use this data to bootstrap AI tools that support knowledge workers.*
- Our first product will be an AI tutor that helps people learn how to program and connects them with practical projects.
- The next step will be an AI assistant for professional level teams.
- *Our long-term vision is computational intelligence based on collective intelligence.*

* Next steps
