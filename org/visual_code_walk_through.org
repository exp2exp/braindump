- /‘Would anyone want to use this?’/

- MAUDE framework. :: You describe your programming language using
  rewrite rules in K.  They define tools to auto-derive rules in [[http://www.kframework.org/index.php/Projects][K]].

- Program slicing :: ‘Galois connection on the traces’. This allows
  you to find where bugs appeared.  People tend to look in the most
  recent.  Imagine a call-graph of all the variables, so it gives you
  a minimum trace, showing where your bug can be found.
