## Graphical flow for programs {#graphical-flow-for-programs}

Can we model more general program flow in a similar fashion to Monocl?


## Limitations {#limitations}

The idea of graphical programming languages is linked with the
[Deutsch\_limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%5Flimit) (for noted programmer [L Peter Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.%5FPeter%5FDeutsch), not [David Deutsch
FRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%5FDeutsch), though perhaps he could come into play later):

> _The problem with visual programming is that you canâ€™t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time._


## Automatically create visual interfaces {#automatically-create-visual-interfaces}

Here's an idea: assuming we have enough text mining pixie dust (on
corpora of linux man pages, and stack overflow questions/forum posts
about linux commands), it might be possible to do:

`user:~$ make-gui-for ls --output ls.py`
