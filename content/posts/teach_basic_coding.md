We were thinking of _How to Design Programs_ (HtDP) as a potential
basis for this work.  We would want to respect category theoretic
concepts in the presentation.

There are analogues in settings like Bayesian modelling.

We could look at relationships with argumentation theory, thinking
about how to do this in a theoretically consistent way.  Once we have
a definition of the programming language we’re going to use, we can
then do argumentation over that.

Could we have a DSL for HtDP ideas, then we could reuse it to generate
patterns for learning how to design some other structure (say, web
pages or probabilistic programs).

To do this well you’d need ways to express ‘recipes’.  For example, an
MVP might be based on representing HtDP-style recipes using sequent
calculi for session types.  These represent interactive protocols.

You’d use cut-elimination to have two players interact (using
something like the Lakatos Game diagram).  But what formalism would
you use?  E.g., _geometry of interaction in linear logic_ has been
used for this kind of thing, but could it be used here?
