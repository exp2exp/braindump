Our purpose:

-   **We want to make the knowledge economy accessible to everyone.**
-   **Web 2.0 hasnâ€™t achieved that, although it has produced a large pool of open data.**
-   **We will use this data to bootstrap AI tools that support knowledge workers.**
-   Our first product will be an AI tutor that helps people learn how to program and connects them with practical projects.
-   The next step will be an AI assistant for professional level teams.
-   **Our long-term vision is computational intelligence based on collective intelligence.**
