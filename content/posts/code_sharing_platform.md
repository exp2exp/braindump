Cameron shared ideas about a code-sharing platform.  For now we have a
Github organisation (<https://github.com/exp2exp>), as well as a
separate repo that contains these Org Roam notes, among other things.


## Comments {#comments}

-   Nextjournal is interesting
-   It's like a Jupyter notebook
-   It's like Org Bable so you can run code in any language within the same environment
-   If I need to add a bash cell to a Julia notebook, it adds a kernel as needed at the run time
-   If I install a bunch of libraries, and save the current environment in a docker container, you can import it
-   It doesn't yet have an easy way to make an app?


## What if you had a browser based version of Org Bable? {#what-if-you-had-a-browser-based-version-of-org-bable}

-   You could have your notebook, backed by the ability to use Emacs


## Examples {#examples}

-   Setting up a data science experiment
-   Wadler et al. course in Agda in NextJournal
-   But you can't easily treat this as ‘Org Roam’ (no bi-directional things)
